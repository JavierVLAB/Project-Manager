# Weekly Resource Calendar - MVP Iteration 5

A dynamic weekly calendar application built with Next.js 14+ and TypeScript, featuring drag-and-drop assignment management, resize functionality, inline editing, capacity calculation with visual indicators, local persistence, and week navigation with 4-week view.

## Features

- **4-Week Calendar View**: Displays 4 weeks starting from the selected week with navigation controls
- **Week Navigation**: Navigate to previous/next weeks or jump to current week with "Hoy" button
- **Person Management**: Add and edit people with name and role
- **Project Management**: Add and edit projects with name and color
- **Assignment Creation**: Manually create assignments by selecting person, project, date range, and percentage
- **Drag and Drop**: Move assignment bars horizontally between weeks with weekly snap
- **Resize Assignments**: Adjust assignment duration by dragging the right edge
- **Percentage Editing**: Click on assignment bars to edit percentage allocation inline
- **Collision Prevention**: Automatic validation prevents overlapping assignments for the same person
- **Weekly Snap**: Assignments snap to day boundaries for precise positioning
- **Person Rows**: Each person has their own row showing their role, assignments, and capacity indicators
- **Assignment Bars**: Visual representation of project assignments with percentage-based widths and colors, supporting multiple overlapping assignments through vertical stacking
- **Project Legend**: Sidebar displaying all projects with their corresponding colors for easy reference
- **Capacity Calculation**: Automatic calculation of weekly capacity per person based on assignment percentages
- **Visual Semaphore**: Progress bar with color-coded capacity indicators (green ≤100%, amber 100-120%, red >120%)
- **Local Persistence**: Automatic save/load of people, projects, and assignments in localStorage
- **Capacity Validation**: Prevents assignments that would exceed 150% capacity limit
- **Modular Architecture**: Built following SOLID principles with single-responsibility components and custom hooks
- **Dynamic Data**: Zustand store with actions for adding/updating entities and persistence
- **Form Validations**: Basic validations in all CRUD forms including capacity checks

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
2. Clone or navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash

5. Navigate weeks:
    - Use "Anterior" to go to previous week, "Siguiente" to next, "Hoy" to current week
    - View the selected 4-week range displayed

6. View the calendar with:
    - Person information on the left
